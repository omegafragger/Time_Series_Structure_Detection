In order to run the segmentation algorithm follow the steps given below:

Step 1: Store the time-series to be segmented in the file "segmentation_data.txt". The series should be stored in column format. For instance, a time-series [1,2,3] should be stored as:
1
2
3

Step 2: Run the "segmentation_script". The graph output will show the segmented time-series.
