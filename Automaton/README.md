In order to train and test the proposed model on any year in the period: 1990 - 1999 on any time-series: TAIEX, NASDAQ or DJIA follow the steps given below:

Step 1: Run the "main_script".

Step 2: Enter the time-series on which you want the training and testing to be carried out: (TAIEX or NASDAQ or DOW) at the prompt.

Step 3: Enter the year for which you want to carry out the training and testing: (any year within 1990 - 1999).

The program will output the DSA generated from the training phase time-series as well as the predictions in the test phase. 
The predictions include the predicted structure at a given segment boundary as well as the expected duration of the structure.
The program also reports the overall RMSE of prediction and plots the graph of actual and predicted time-points.
