In order to run the clustering algorithm follow the steps given below:

Step 1: Run the "cluster_script".

Step 2: Input the time-series whose segments you want to be clustered at the prompt.
The segment data for each time-series is stored in the files "param_bank_mn_taiex.mat", "param_bank_mn_nasdaq.mat" and "param_bank_mn_dow.mat".
The output of the clustering algorithm will plot the cluster centers generated from the segments.
